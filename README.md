2. Set the request type to `GET`.
3. Enter the URL of your API endpoint:

   ```
   GET http://localhost:8000/api/movies
   ```

4. Add a query parameter named `artist_name` with the value set to the name of the artist you want to search for.
5. Click on the "Send" button to make the request.
6. View the response to see the list of movies associated with the artist.
